{\bf Secondary screen for regulators of Or47b expression using gene-specific RNAi.}

\textbf{A.} Tabular summary of the target predictions made by three different algorithms for each miRNA whose over-expression reduces Or47b expression.
\textbf{B.} The number of genes that appear on the TargetScan candidate target lists in A.
\textbf{C.} Twenty-two genes, including Atf3, appear on the candidate target lists for 3 different miRNAs.
\textbf{D.} A schematized view of the Atf3 (A3-3) 3'-UTR showing the locations of seed matches for miR-2a and miR-33, which reduce Or47b expression.
\textbf{E.} Atf3 knockdown in all olfactory neurons using Pbl-GAL4 reduces expression of an Or47b reporter, but spares expression of an Or92a reporter.
\textbf{F.} Antennal \textit{in situ} hybridization with mixed riboprobes that recognize Or47b (blue) and Or92a (red) reveals that Atf3 knockdown eliminates Or47b expression, but spares Or92a expression.
\textbf{G.} An Atf3::eGFP fusion protein lacking the Atf3 3'-UTR, which contains the miR-2a-2 binding site, rescues the loss of Or47b expression observed with miR-2a-2 over-expression.
