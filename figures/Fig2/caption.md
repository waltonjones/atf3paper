**Primary screen for miRNAs whose over-expression alters OR reporter expression in the antennal lobe.** **A.** A two-tiered, miRNA-based screening workflow can accelerate loss-of-function genetic screens by limiting the number of necessary gene-specific RNAi crosses. **B.** Antennal lobe (AL) staining of the control Pbl-GAL4/+; Or47b>CD8::GFP, Or92a>CD8::GFP/+ controls shows strong GFP staining in both the Or47b glomerulus VA1lm (blue arrowhead) and the Or92a glomerulus VA2 (red arrowhead). **C.** Mixed probe *in situ* on the same control genotype as in B. Or92a-expressing cells are circled in red, while Or47b-expressing cells are circled in blue. **D.** AL staining for 3 of the 7 miRNAs whose over-expression induces loss of the Or47b reporter (blue arrowheads). **E.** AL staining for 3 of the 4 miRNAs whose over-expression induces loss of the Or92a reporter (red arrowheads). **F.** AL staining for the 3 miRNAs whose over-expression induces loss of both the Or47b and Or92a reporters (blue and red arrowheads). **G.** Mixed Or47b/Or92a probe *in situs* on antennae of the genotypes shows in D confirm the loss of Or47b expression induced by miR-263a, miR-2a-2, and miR-2491.
