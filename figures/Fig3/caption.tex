{\bf Atf3 is required for the expression of Or47b.}

\textbf{A.} Orco-GAL4 driven knockdown of Atf3 does not affect the morphology of the Or47b neurons, nor does it affect Orco expression or dendritic localization.
\textbf{B.} An Atf3::eGFP protein fusion under the control of the Atf3 promoter is co-expressed with Or47b-GAL4 driving UAS-TdTomato in Or47b neurons.
\textbf{C.} Over-expression of Atf3 in most adult OSNs using Orco-GAL4 does not expand the expression of Or47b.
\textbf{D.} When compared to the UAS-atf3-IR control (left), Orco-GAL4 driven knockdown of Atf3 eliminates Or47b expression (center), but this can be partially rescued by UAS-Atf3 (right). Rescued cells are indicated with open triangles.
\textbf{E.} (Left) Atf3-null atf\textsuperscript{76} mutant antennae show normal Or92a expression (circled in red), but lack Or47b expression (circled in blue). (Right) The Atf3::eGFP transgene rescues Or47b expression in atf3\textsuperscript{76} antennae.
\textbf{F.} Knock-down of Atf3 in most OSNs using Orco-GAL4 eliminates Or43b expression. Or43b-positive cells are indicated with open triangles.
