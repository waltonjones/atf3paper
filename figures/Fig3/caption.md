**\label{fig:3} - Secondary screen for regulators of Or47b expression using gene-specific RNAi**

**A.** Tabular summary of the target predictions made by three different algorithms for each miRNA whose overexpression reduces Or47b expression. **B.** The number of genes that appear on the TargetScan candidate target lists in A. **C.** Twenty-two genes, including Atf3, appear on the candidate target lists for 3 different miRNAs. **D.** A schematized view of the Atf3 (A3-3) 3'-UTR showing the locations of seed matches for miR-2a and miR-33, which reduce Or47b expression. **E.** Atf3 knockdown in all olfactory neurons using Pbl-Gal4 reduces expression of an Or47b reporter, but spares expression of an Or92a reporter. **F.** Antennal *in situ* hybridization with mixed riboprobes that recognize Or47b (blue) and Or92a (red) reveals that Atf3 knockdown eliminates Or47b expression, but spares Or92a expression. **G.** An Atf3::eGFP fusion protein lacking the Atf3 3'-UTR, which contains the miR-2a-2 binding site, rescues the loss of Or47b expression observed with miR-2a-2 overexpression.
