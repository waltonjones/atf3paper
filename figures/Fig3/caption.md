**Atf3 is required for the expression of Or47b.** **A.** RNA *in situ* hybridization using an anti-*atf3* probe on control antennae reveals broad expression in adult olfactory neurons. **B.** An Atf3::eGFP protein fusion under the control of the Atf3 promoter is co-expressed with Or47b-GAL4 driving UAS-TdTomato in Or47b neurons. **C.** Over-expression of Atf3 in most adult OSNs using Orco-GAL4 does not expand the expression of Or47b. **D.** When compared to the UAS-atf3-IR control (left), Orco-GAL4 driven knockdown of Atf3 eliminates Or47b expression (center), but this can be partially rescued by UAS-Atf3 (right). **E.** Orco-GAL4 driven knockdown of Atf3 does not affect the morphology of the Or47b neurons, nor does it affect Orco expression or dendritic localization. **F.** The Or47b promoter contains a putative Atf3 binding site.
