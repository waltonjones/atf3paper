## Two-tiered miRNA-based screening

The three collections of UAS-miRNA stocks published recently were presented as tools either for identifying novel miRNA functions \cite{aleigh_Kim_Ni_Duan_et_al__2012,shauser_Forstemann_Basler_2012} or for use in the context of screens for modifiers of existing developmental phenotypes \cite{gler_Lim_Verma_Chen_Cohen_2012}. Rather than using our UAS-miRNA lines to study miRNA biology, we decided to examine whether they could also be used as a tool permitting a "pooling" pre-screen designed to limit the focus and thus accelerate a secondary, but more traditional RNAi-based loss-of-function screen. In such a scheme, after identifying miRNAs whose overexpression induces a phenotype of interest, bioinformatic target prediction provides a list of candidate genes for a follow-up RNAi screen. Since miRNAs inhibit the translation of or induce degradation of their target mRNAs, any phenotype observed with miRNA overexpression should be replicable via RNAi knockdown of the responsible target. Figure \ref{fig:2}A presents a generalized flowchart of this two-tiered screening strategy.


## Primary screen for regulators of OR expression using miRNAs

As stated in the introduction, we settled on *Drosophila* olfactory neurons to demonstrate our miRNA-based screening strategy. Like Jafari et al., we chose Pbl-Gal4 to drive expression of UAS-miRNAs in adult olfactory neurons because it is expressed strongly in peripheral sensory neurons beginning 12-18 hours after pupation \cite{dnik_Dickson_Luo_Komiyama_2007}. By combining Pbl-Gal4 with fusions of two odorant receptor promoters (i.e., Or92a and Or47b) to the coding sequence for a membrane-tethered GFP and crossing in the UAS-miRNAs, we were able to visualize the effects of miRNAs on OR expression. Or92a is expressed in large basiconic sensilla in a class of OSN called ab1B, which respond to 2,3-butanedione \cite{de_Bruyne_Foster_Carlson_2001}. Or47b is expressed in trichoid sensilla in a class of OSNs called at4, which respond to fly-derived odors \cite{http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.043}. We chose Or92a and Or47b because they are expressed in olfactory neurons that innervate prominent, well-separated glomeruli in the antennal lobe (VA2 and VA1lm, **Fig. \ref{fig:2}B**) and whose cell bodies are easily distinguishable upon antennal RNA *in situ* hybridization **Fig. \ref{fig:2}C**).

> Of 133 UAS-miRNA lines screened, 20 of the miRNAs were found to be lethal when crossed to Pbl-Gal4 (supplemental). Some over-expression of miRNAs that caused egg laying deficiency, larvae or pupae lethality or only few (3-4) sick flies eclosed out were left out of screening.(Supplementary).)
