## Two-tiered miRNA-based screening

The three collections of UAS-miRNA stocks published recently were presented as tools for identifying novel miRNA functions \cite{aleigh_Kim_Ni_Duan_et_al__2012,shauser_Forstemann_Basler_2012} or for use in the context of screens for modifiers of existing developmental phenotypes \cite{gler_Lim_Verma_Chen_Cohen_2012}. Rather than using our UAS-miRNA lines to study miRNA biology, we decided to examine whether they could also be used as a tool permitting a "pooling" pre-screen designed to limit the focus of a secondary, but more traditional RNAi-based screen.

## Primary screen for regulators of OR expression using miRNAs

We chose Pbl-Gal4 to drive expression of UAS-miRNAs in adult olfactory neurons because it is expressed strongly in peripheral sensory neurons beginning 12-18 hours after pupation \cite{dnik_Dickson_Luo_Komiyama_2007}. By combining Pbl-Gal4 with fusions of two odorant receptor promoters (i.e., Or92a and Or47b) to the coding sequence for a membrane-tethered GFP and crossing in the UAS-miRNAs, we were able to visualize the effects of miRNA expression on OR expression.

> (Or92a neurons project to the VA2 glomerulus whereas Or47b neurons project to the VA1lm glomerulus at the ventrolateral edge of the antennal lobe. Of 133 UAS-miRNA lines screened, 20 of the miRNAs were found to be lethal when crossed to Pbl-Gal4 (supplemental). Some over-expression of miRNAs that caused egg laying deficiency, larve or pupae lethalilty or only few (3-4) sick flies eclosed out were left out of screening.(Supplementary).)
