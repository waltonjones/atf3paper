To determine if miRNAs play a role in OR expression,  UAS-miRNA library of Drosophila stocks was used for tissue-specific over-expression of specific miRNAs.  The standard GAL4-UAS system was used. (refer) To adapt this system in over-expression experiments and to find a way to visualize a limited but specific population of ORNs, the fusions of OR promoters to GFP were used.  The two OR promoter fusion of Or47b and Or92a neurons were selected because the glomeruli they innervate are large and easy to identify. Or92a neurons project to the VA2 glomerulus whereas Or47b neurons project to the VA1lm glomerulus at the ventrolateral edge of the antennal lobe. (refer) The pebbled-GAL4 driver line, that is expressed in peripheral sensory neurons throughout pupation, with the OR promoter fusion to Or47b and Or92a (refer) was used for the tissue-specific over-expression of miRNAs. Fly brain was immunostained for visualizing any loss of GFP expression.

In two separate rounds the effect of over-expression of miRNA was analysed. The individual miRNAs gave 3 distinct class of tissue specific loss of OR phenotype. (Fig B). We found the list of miRNAs that cause exclusively loss of Or47b, loss of Or92a and loss of both the ORs (Fig 2B and Supplementary).  Of 133 UAS-miRNA lines screened, 20 of the miRNAs were found to be lethal. Some over-expression of miRNAs that caused egg laying deficiency, larve or pupae lethalilty or only few (3-4) sick flies eclosed out were left out of screening.(Supplementary). In order to rule out the false positives, the experiments were reproduced thrice and mixed probe in situ hybridization for Or47b and Or92a were performed. (See materials and methods). The clear loss Or47b transcript by in situ hybridization validates the immunostaining results produced by over-expression of certain miRNAs. (Fig2 c)
