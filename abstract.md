The _Drosophila_ olfactory system is highly sterotyped in form and function; the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing a specific odorant receptor (ORs) always appear in the same antennal location and the axons of ORNs expressing the same OR converge on the same antennal lobe glomeruli. Although several transcription factors have been implicated in a combinatorial code specifying OR expression and ORN identity, it is clear several players remain unidentified. To mitigate the challenges of genome-wide screening, we propose a two-tiered approach comprising a primary "pooling" screen for miRNAs whose tissue-specific over-expression causes a phenotype of interest followed by a focused secondary screen using gene-specific RNAi. Since miRNAs down-regulate their target mRNAs, miRNA over-expression phenotypes should be attributable to target loss-of-function. Since miRNA-target pairing is sequence-dependent, predicted targets of miRNAs identified in the primary screen are candidates for the secondary RNAi-based screen. Since miRNAs are short, miRNA misexpression undoubtedly uncovers non-biological miRNA-target relationships. Thus, we are using our UAS-miRNA stocks as tools to point elsewhere rather than focusing on miRNA function. Here we describe a proof-of-concept, two-tiered, miRNA-based screen that identifies a novel function of Activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) in the expression of the odorant receptor Or47b.
