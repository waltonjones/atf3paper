\subsection*{\emph{Drosophila} stocks}

All stocks were maintained at $25\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ on conventional media.
For the two screening steps, virgin females (Pbl-GAL4, UAS-Dcr2;Or47b\textgreater{}CD8::GFP, Or92a\textgreater{}CD8::GFP) or Orco-GAL4 (BDSC 26818), were mated to either UAS-miRNA or UAS-IR (inverted repeat) males.
The crosses were maintained at $25\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ until being shifted to $27\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ during pupation to enhance GAL4 expression.
All UAS-miRNA and UAS-IR lines that reduce the expression of the GFP reporters were checked 2-3 times to ensure reproducibility.
Two different UAS-Atf3-IR lines (BDSC 26741 and VDRC 105036) produced identical phenotypes.
