\subsection*{Two-tiered miRNA-based screening}

Three other collections of UAS-miRNA stocks published recently were presented as tools either for identifying novel miRNA functions \cite{aleigh_Kim_Ni_Duan_et_al__2012,shauser_Forstemann_Basler_2012} or for use in the context of screens for modifiers of existing developmental phenotypes \cite{gler_Lim_Verma_Chen_Cohen_2012}.
Rather than using the UAS-miRNA lines we generated \cite{suh:2015aa} to study miRNA biology, we decided to examine whether they could also be used as a tool permitting a "pooling" pre-screen designed to limit the focus and thus accelerate a secondary, but more traditional RNAi-based loss-of-function screen.
In such a scheme, after identifying miRNAs whose over-expression induces a phenotype of interest, bioinformatic target prediction provides a list of candidate genes for a follow-up RNAi screen.
Since miRNAs inhibit the translation of or induce degradation of their target mRNAs, any phenotype observed with miRNA over-expression should be replicable via RNAi knockdown of the responsible target(s).
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:1}A} presents a generalized flowchart of this two-tiered screening strategy.
