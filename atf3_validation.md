## Validation of a role for Atf3 in Or47b expression

Atf3 is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors. In *Drosophila*, Atf3 functions in immune and metabolic homeostasis as well as abdominal morphogenesis \citep{Brodesser_Jindra_Uhlirova_2012,a_Bohmann_Jindra_Uhlirova_2009}. We confirmed that Atf3 is expressed in Or47b neurons by combining an Atf3 protein fusion to eGFP under the transcriptional control of the Atf3 promoter with an Or47b-GAL4 line driving the red fluorescent marker UAS-TdTomato (**Fig. 3B**). Consistent with a role for Atf3 in Or47b expression rather than olfactory neurogenesis, knockdown of Atf3 does not affect OSN morphology, Orco expression, or Orco localization (**Fig. 3A**).

The fact that the other transcription factors implicated in OR expression (e.g., Acj6, Pdm3, Xbp1, Eip93f, etc.) work together as part of a combinatorial code that includes both transcriptional activators and repressors \citep{Brochtrup_Hummel_Alenius_2012}, suggests that broad antennal over-expression of Atf3 may expand the expression pattern of Or47b. On the contrary, the combination of UAS-Atf3 with the olfactory co-receptor Orco-GAL4 line, which drives expression in most antennal OSNs, has no effect on the Or47b expression pattern (**Fig. 3C**). This suggests that either other OSN populations express sufficient repressive transcription factors to prevent Or47b expression or lack an Atf3 binding partner required for Or47b activation.

We used Pbl-GAL4 in our two-tiered miRNA-based screen because it drives expression in peripheral sensory neurons including those of the developing antenna beginning 12-18 hours after puparium formation (APF) \citep{dnik_Dickson_Luo_Komiyama_2007}. Since Pbl-GAL4 expression begins soon after the birth of the OSNs and long before the earliest OR expression begins at 50 hours APF, it is possible that Atf3 plays a developmental role in Or47b-expressing neurons. Thus, we repeated the Atf3 loss-of-function experiment using Orco-GAL4, which begins to drive expression in antennal OSNs at roughly 80 hours APF, after olfactory development is complete \citep{s_Chiappe_Amrein_Vosshall_2004}. Like the result with Pbl-GAL4, knockdown of Atf3 using Orco-GAL4 eliminates Or47b expression, and this loss of Or47b expression can be partially rescued by re-introduction of Atf3 (**Fig. 3D**).
