## Validation of a role for Atf3 in Or47b expression

Atf3 is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors. In *Drosophila*, Atf3 functions in immune and metabolic homeostasis as well as abdominal morphogenesis \cite{http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/MCB.00429-12, http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/dev.037861}. To determine whether Atf3 is expressed in the adult antenna, we amplified and cloned an 800 bp fragment of the *atf3* cDNA from a cDNA library generated by reverse transcription of antennal RNA isolated from wild type Canton S antennae. We used this cDNA as a template for the *in vitro* transcription of an anti-*atf3* riboprobe, and performed RNA *in situ* hybridization on antennal sections of control flies (i.e., the w1118 genetic background strain). We observed that Atf3 is expressed in olfactory neurons all over the antenna, including the distolateral portion where the Or47b-expressing neurons are located (**\ref{fig:4}A**). We next confirmed that Atf3 is expressed in Or47b neurons by combining an Atf3 protein fusion to eGFP under the transcriptional control of the Atf3 promoter with an Or47b-Gal4 line driving the red fluorescent marker UAS-TdTomato (**Figure \ref{fig:4}B**). 

The fact that the other transcription factors implicated in OR expression (e.g., Acj6, Pdm3, Xbp1, Eip93f, etc.) work together as part of a combinatorial code that includes both transcriptional activators and repressors \cite{}, suggests that broad antennal overexpression of Atf3 may expand the expression pattern of Or47b. On the contrary, the combination of UAS-Atf3 with the olfactory co-receptor Orco-Gal4 line, which drives expression in most antennal OSNs, has no effect on the Or47b expression pattern (**Fig. \ref{fig:4}C**). This suggests that either other OSN populations express sufficient repressive transcription factors to prevent Or47b expression or lack an Atf3 binding partner required for Or47b activation.

For our two-tiered miRNA-based screen we used Pbl-Gal4, which drives expression in peripheral sensory neurons including those of the developing antenna beginning 12-18 hours after puparium formation (APF) \cite{http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2006.12.022}. Since Pbl-Gal4 expression begins soon after the birth of the OSNs and long before the earliest OR expression begins at 50 hours APF, it is possible that Atf3 plays a developmental role in Or47b-expressing neurons. Thus, we repeated the Atf3 loss-of-function experiment using Orco-Gal4, which begins to drive expression in antennal OSNs at roughly 80 hours APF, after olfactory development is complete \cite{http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2004.08.019}. Like the result with Pbl-Gal4, knockdown of Atf3 using Orco-Gal4 eliminates Or47b expression, and this loss of Or47b expression can be partially rescued by re-introduction of Atf3 (**Fig. \ref{fig:4}D**). Consistent with a role for Atf3 in Or47b expression rather than olfactory neurogenesis, knockdown of Atf3 does not affect OSN morphology, Orco expression, or Orco localization (**Fig. \ref{fig:4}E**).

Despite providing ample evidence of a role for Atf3 in Or47b expression, it remains unclear whether Atf3 is acting directly on the Or47b promoter. Miller and Carlson generated a series of Gal4 lines from truncated Or47b promoters. They observed that promoters of 7.6 kilobases down to 419 base pairs drive expression in a small population of neurons in the distolateral antenna similar to the RNA *in situ* pattern circled in blue in **Fig. \ref{fig:3}F**. Further truncation expands the range of labeled cells into the proximal antenna and the maxillary palps \cite{http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.110.117622}. Their results suggest the existence of an essential repressor binding site in the Or47b promoter between 419 and 342 bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and an essential activator binding site between 219 bp and 119 bp upstream of the TSS. Unfortunately, there is no clear binding site that matches the only published \cite{http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/dev.037861} consensus sequence recognized by *Drosophila* Atf3, TGACGTCA in the Or47b promoter. There is a published \cite{http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature03441} consensus site that would be recognized by mammalian Atf3 (TGAYRTCA) 918 bp upstream of the TSS, but this falls outside of the -219 to -119 bp range suggested by Miller and Carlson \cite{http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.110.117622}. Thus, although further experiments are necessary to determine the exact mechanism of action by which Atf3 regulates Or47b expression, our accelerated miRNA-based screening system permitted the rapid identification of a novel gene involved in Or expression in less than 180 crosses.
