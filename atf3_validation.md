## Atf3 validation

## Figure 4: Atf3 is required in the antennae for Atf3 expression:
A. Antennal expression of atf3 (in situ)
B. Atf3 is expressed in Or47b neurons (Or47b-Gal4>TdTomato; GFP::Atf3)
C. Rescue of Atf3 in Orco neurons rescues Or47b expression (in situ and/or IHC)

The positive hit, Atf3 that adds to the list of transcription factors that play vital role in OR expression ( refer alenius, ray et al, 2007, song et al 2012)  is a single fly ortholog of the vertebrate activating transcription factor 3. Atf3 belongs to the family of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. Atf3 is known to regulate the metabolic and immune system homeostasis in fly (refer uhlirova). The construct that expresses atf3::EGFP fusion protein under the natural atf3 regulatory sequence has shown moderate Atf3::EGFP expression in the brain, ring gland, eye/antennal imaginal disc and wing disc of third instar larva of atf3 BAC clone.(refer uhlirova 2012). The diversified tissues expressesing Atf3, hints the possibility of its regulatory role in them.

We next asked whether the TF expression co-related with the OR expression in the adult antennae. The cDNA was prepared using Canton S antennal RNA devoid of head and body. Using antennal origin cDNA as a template, ~800 bp of cDNA was PCR amplified by Atf3 specific primers. The amplified product was TA cloned to pGEMT-easy vector and confirmed by sequencing prior preparing riboprobes. The in situ hybridization on the wild type antennae with minor changes in washing temperature, and hybridization time (see material and methods for details) was performed. Moderately low level of Atf3 expression was seen in the adult fly antennae. (Fig.4a)

As the knock down of Atf3 resulted in the loss of Or47b expression, we hypothesized that in order to cause the selective loss, Atf3 transcription factor must ideally be present in Or47b neurons. We used Or47b-GAL4, and combined it with UAS-Td-Tomato construct, so that Td-tomato signal is a result of Or47b-GAL4. Atf3::EGFP clone was used to confirm the hypothesis. The co-expression of GFP with Td-tomato Or47b expressing neurons by antennal staining suggest that (yet to complete experiment ) (Fig 4B)
