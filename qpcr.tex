\subsection*{Quantitative PCR}

RNA was isolated from antennal samples using Easy Blue reagent (Invitrogen). Isolated RNA was then subjected to DNAse1 treatment using RNAase free DNAase I (Takara, Japan). About 2 ug of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA by SuperScript III first strand synthesis system(Invitrogen). qPCR was performed using SYBR Green reagent on StepOne Plus Sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, USA).Atleast two biological replicates in triplicates were analyzed atleast two times using comparative cycle threshold after normalizing to rp49 levels. P value was determined by t-test and data was plotted by using program R. The primers used for qPCR are mentioned in Supplementary Table 1.
