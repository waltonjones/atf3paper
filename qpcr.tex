\subsection*{Quantitative PCR}

RNA was isolated from 40-50 dissected antennae per genotype using the easy-BLUE kit (Intron, South Korea) and treated with RNAase-free DNAase I (Takara, Japan). Antennal cDNAs were synthesized adding 2 \mu{}g of total antennal RNAs to the SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, USA). Quantitative PCR was performed using the SYBR Green reagent on a StepOne Plus Sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, USA). Relative concentrations were calculated with the 2\textsuperscript{-\Delta{}\Delta{}Ct} method using rp49 as a control and statistical significance was determined using a t-test. Primer sequences are included in Supplementary Table 2.
