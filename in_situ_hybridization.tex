\subsection*{\emph{In situ} hybridization}

\emph{In situ} hybridization on frozen antennal sections was performed as previously described \cite{ein_Morozov_Rzhetsky_Axel_1999} using probes generated by \emph{in vitro} transcription from cDNAs cloned using standard methods into the pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega, USA).
