\subsection*{\emph{In situ} hybridization}

\emph{In situ} hybridization on frozen antennal sections was performed as previously described \cite{ein_Morozov_Rzhetsky_Axel_1999} using probes generated by \emph{in vitro} transcription from cDNAs for Or47b and Or92a, in the pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega).
The cDNAs were cloned using standard methods using the following primers: Or47b (5'-CGGGTTATCAATCAAATCTCAGCC-3', 5'-GTGGAACCTCTTATCACTGACCTC-3') and Or92a (5'-TGTGGTGGGCGAAATCGCGT-3', 5'-TGTGGTGCGGAGCAGTGCAA-3').
\emph{In situs} were developed for 3 hours.
