# Summary

Large scale genetic screening is tedious and time-consuming. In an effort to mitigate this problem, we propose a two-tiered screening system comprising an initial "pooling" screen that identifies miRNAs whose tissue-specific over-expression causes a phenotype of interest followed by a more focused secondary screen that uses gene-specific RNAi. As miRNAs inhibit translation or direct the destruction of their target mRNAs, any phenotype observed with miRNA over-expression can be attributed to the loss-of-function of one or more target mRNAs. Since miRNA-target pairing is sequence-specific, a list of predicted targets for miRNAs identified in the initial screen serves as a list of candidates for the secondary RNAi-based screen. These predicted miRNA targets can be prioritized by expression pattern, and if multiple miRNAs produce the same phenotype, overlapping target predictions can be given higher priority in the follow-up screen.

Since miRNAs are short, miRNA misexpression will likely produce non-biological miRNA-target relationships. Thus, we are using miRNAs as a tool to accelerate genetic screening rather than focus on the biology of miRNAs themselves. This two-tiered system allows us to rapidly identify individual target genes involved in a phenomenon of interest. Here we provide a proof-of-concept miRNA-based screen in which we identify and validate a novel role for the transcription factor Atf3 in the expression of the socially relevant receptor Or47b.
