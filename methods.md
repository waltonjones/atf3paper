# Materials and methods

## *Drosophila* stocks
All stocks were maintained at 25ºC on conventional media. For the two screening steps, virgin females (Pbl-GAL4, UAS-Dcr2;Or47b>CD8::GFP, Or92a>CD8::GFP) or Orco-GAL4 (BDSC 26818), were mated to either UAS-miRNA or UAS-IR (inverted repeat) males. The crosses were maintained at 25ºC until being shifted to 27ºC during pupation to enhance GAL4 expression. All UAS-miRNA and UAS-IR lines that reduce the expression of the GFP reporters were checked 2-3 times to ensure reproducibility. Two different UAS-Atf3-IR lines (BDSC 26741 and VDRC 105036) produced identical phenotypes.

## Immunostaining
Brains were dissected and stained as previously described \citep{Halter_Fischbach_Stocker_1999} 3-4 days after eclosion with an anti-GFP antibody (1:1000, Molecular Probes) and the monoclonal antibody nc82 (1:50, DHSB), which recognizes neuropil. Frozen antennal sections were stained as described previously \citep{s_Chiappe_Amrein_Vosshall_2004} using an anti-GFP antibody (1:1000, Molecular Probes), anti-Cleaved Caspase-3 antibody (1:100, Cell Signaling), anti-22C10 (1:100, DHSB)  and an anti-Orco antibody (1:5000) raised against the peptide (SSIPVEIPRLPIKS) by AbFrontier. 

## *In situ* hybridization
*In situ* hybridization on frozen antennal sections was carried out as previously described \citep{ein_Morozov_Rzhetsky_Axel_1999} using probes generated by *in vitro* transcription from cDNAs for Or47b and Or92a, in the pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega). The cDNAs were cloned using standard methods using the following primers: Or47b (CGGGTTATCAATCAAATCTCAGCC,GTGGAACCTCTTATCACTGACCTC) and Or92a (TGTGGTGGGCGAAATCGCGT,TGTGGTGCGGAGCAGTGCAA). *In situs* were developed for 3 hours.
