## UAS-miRNA stock generation
We obtained 44 UAS-DsRed-miRNA constructs from the [*Drosophila* RNAi Screening Center](http://www.flyrnai.org) originally published by Silver et al. \cite{agen_Okamura_Perrimon_Lai_2007}. We inserted a minimal attB site into these vectors to make them suitable for site-specific insertion into the fly genome. For the rest of the UAS-miRNA stocks, we modified the pKC27-derived attB-containing SST13 UAS vector, which makes use of the split-white system to reduce the time spent on off-target insertions \cite{apici_Kim_Ribeiro_Dickson_2007}. We inserted additional restriction sites between the KpnI and XbaI sites of the SST13 polylinker. Inspired by the design of the Silver et al. UAS-miRNA vectors \cite{agen_Okamura_Perrimon_Lai_2007}, we inserted either the DsRed or mCherry coding sequence downstream of a 5X UAS sequence and renamed these vectors pSS-DsRed and pSS-mCherry (Map and sequence available upon request). Next, we amplified putative pri-miRNA sequences consisting of roughly 400-500 bp surrounding each mature miRNA from Canton S or w1118 genomic DNA and inserted them into the 3'-UTR of the fluorescent marker in each pSS vector. We made constructs for individual miRNAs where possible, but cloned tightly clustered miRNAs en masse. We validated all of our UAS-miRNA vectors with restriction digests and sequencing. Supplemental table 1 summarizes the UAS-miRNA constructs and the primers used to make them. All UAS-miRNA constructs were injected into embryos of the attP-72A landing site strain (n.b., 2nd chromosome) using standard microinjection techniques.

## *Drosophila* stocks
All stocks were maintained at 25ºC on conventional media. For validating the UAS-miRNA library, virgin females from GMR-GAL4 (BDSC 9146) and nubbin-GAL4 (BDSC 25754) were mated to UAS-miRNA males. For the two screening steps, virgin females (Pbl-GAL4, UAS-Dcr2;Or47b>CD8::GFP, Or92a>CD8::GFP) or Orco-GAL4 (BDSC 26818), were mated to either UAS-miRNA or UAS-IR (inverted repeat) males. The crosses were maintained at 25ºC until being shifted to 27ºC during pupation to enhance GAL4 expression. All UAS-miRNA and UAS-IR lines that reduce the expression of the GFP reporters were checked 2-3 times to ensure reproducibility. Two different UAS-Atf3-IR lines (BDSC 26741 and VDRC 105036) produced identical phenotypes.

## Immunostaining
Brains were dissected and stained as previously described \cite{Halter_Fischbach_Stocker_1999} 3-4 days after eclosion with an anti-GFP antibody (1:1000, Molecular Probes) and the monoclonal antibody nc82 (1:50, DHSB), which recognizes neuropil. Frozen antennal sections were stained as described previously \cite{s_Chiappe_Amrein_Vosshall_2004} using an anti-GFP antibody (1:1000, Molecular Probes) and an anti-Orco antibody (1:5000) raised against the peptide (SSIPVEIPRLPIKS) by AbFrontier. 

## *In situ* hybridization
*In situ* hybridization on frozen antennal sections was carried out as previously described \cite{ein_Morozov_Rzhetsky_Axel_1999} using probes generated by *in vitro* transcription from cDNAs for Or47b, Or92a, and Atf3 in the pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega). The cDNAs were cloned using standard methods using the following primers: Or47b (CGGGTTATCAATCAAATCTCAGCC, GTGGAACCTCTTATCACTGACCTC), Or92a (TGTGGTGGGCGAAATCGCGT, TGTGGTGCGGAGCAGTGCAA), and Atf3 (GTTCAATTCCAACATACCGGCC, GATTTCAGCATGTCCACCAACTTT). Or47b/Or92a *in situs* were developed for 3 hours, but Atf3 *in situs* were developed for 3 days.
