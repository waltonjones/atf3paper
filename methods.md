## Materials and Methods:

### MicroRNA over-expression screen:
When we started this project, there were no UAS-miRNA stocks available; only a group of plasmids capable of driving miRNA expression when used to transform fly embryos had been made available\cite{Silver:2007hz}. 
Virgin flies containing Pebbled-GAL4, UAS-Dicer2, and the OR promoter fusions of OR47b and Or92a were mated with the males obtained from the UAS-miRNA library. The crosses were step up at 25^0, and at the pre-pupal stage vials were shifted to 27^0 until eclosion. 3d-4d post eclosion, brain immunostaining were performed as a score for loss of GFP expression. UAS-miR lines showing loss of GFP in either of ORs were re-tested for the reproducibility.

### MicroRNA target prediction:
The bioinformatic tools such as Target ScanFly, miRanda and Microcosm were used to establish a target list for set of UAS-miRNAs showing loss of GFP expression. For ordering RNAi lines, the overlapping target predictions between all three programs and individual miRNAs showing similar phenotype were set as highest priority
### Secondary RNAi screen: 
Virgin flies from Pebbled-GAL4,UAS-Dicer2 and the OR promoter fusions were crossed to male RNAi flies obtained from VRDC library. The crosses were carried out at 25^0 and the vials were moved to 28^0 at white pupal stage until the eclosure. The flies were incubated at 2-3 days post elcosure at 28^0 and  brains were immunostained for loss of GFP expression. The RNAi lines that gave loss were validated for reproducibility. To further validate the established phenotype, RNAi lines from DGRC were used and only the lines that gave same phenotype were considered positive hit and retained for further analysis.

###  Immunostaining and *in situ* Hybridization:
Immunostaining and in situ hybridization were performed as previously described. (refer).  The OR probes used for the in situ hybridization were cloned into pGEM-T Easy using fly antennal cDNA as template and validated by sequencing.  Atf3 in situ probe was generated by cloning ~800 bp atf3 CDS using cDNA template isolated from the antenna of 4000 wild type flies devoid of head and body.
The antibodies used were anti-nc82 (1:50) and anti-GFP (1:1000).

### Fly stocks:
Pebbled-GAL4 OR promoter fusion lines were kind gift from Alenius Mattias. Atf3 related lines namely Atf3 mutant (yw,atf3(76)/FM7i,P {ActGFP}JMR3),  the Atf3 UAS line (w;UAS-atf3WT/cyo) and pBAC [atf3::EGFP]/TM6B were kind gift from Prof. Uhlirova, M.
miRNA lines used were generated from our lab as previously described and RNAi lines were ordered from Drosophila Stock centre ( Bloomington, Indiana) and VDRC.
