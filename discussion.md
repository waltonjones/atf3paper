# Discussion
Here we report our development of a two-tiered, miRNA-based screening system designed to accelerate the process of genetic screening in *Drosophila*. We generated a collection of transgenic fly stocks that permit the tissue-specific over-expression of miRNAs. Since miRNAs down-regulate their targets, we reasoned that miRNAs could be used for a pooling pre-screen that points the way to a much smaller list of RNAi stocks for follow-up screening than would normally be necessary. We demonstrated this screening method in the olfactory system where we identified a novel role for the transcription factor Atf3 in the expression of the socially relevant odorant receptor Or47b.

Our UAS-miRNA lines are not the first, but previous collections were used for studying miRNA biology directly or in traditional modifier screens \cite{gler_Lim_Verma_Chen_Cohen_2012,aleigh_Kim_Ni_Duan_et_al__2012,shauser_Forstemann_Basler_2012}. In these cases, it was advantageous to produce different types of insertions (i.e., P-element based, and site-specific) each giving a different level of expression. Since we were interested in using our UAS-miRNA lines for genetic screening, we used PhiC31-mediated site-specific recombination to insert all of our UAS-miRNA lines in the same location on chromosome 2. This simplifies the genetics of a screen and permits comparisons between lines.

The clear advantage to a two-tiered miRNA-based screening strategy is a reduction in the total number of crosses necessary to identify a gene associated with a specific phenotype. Genetic screening always depends on a limited human resourceâ€”the patience and endurance of the researcher. In traditional genetic screens the assay for the screened phenotype must be as simple and streamlined as possible to minimize researcher fatigue. In our proof-of-principle screen in the olfactory system, we were able to identify Atf3 in less than 180 crosses. With this level of acceleration, it becomes feasible to design screens with more complicated or time-consuming assays.

It has not escaped our attention, however, that miRNA-based screening is inherently biased and will not be suitable for screening in every tissue or for every phenotype. One type of bias stems from our strict use of endogenous *Drosophila* miRNAs rather than designing short synthetic miRNAs that can target a wider range of genes. Even with a collection of synthetic miRNAs, though, any form of miRNA-based screening will be biased toward identifying genes with longer open reading frames and longer 3'-UTRs. Another potential problem with a miRNA-based approach is the case where a single miRNA produces a synthetic phenotype that is not attributable to a single or predominant target mRNA. Still, we hope that the miRNA-based screening method we describe here will be another useful addition to the geneticist's toolbox.
