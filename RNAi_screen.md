### Figure 3: Secondary RNAi screen for regulators of OR expression:
A. Identification of Atf3 as a gene of interest (miRNA target lists with overlap analysis)
B. Brain staining of Pbl-Gal4>Atf3-IR, OR promoter fusions
C. Mixed probe in situs for Or47b and Or92a on Pbl-Gal4>Atf3-IR and controls
D. miRNA overexpression reduces atf3 expression (Pbl-Gal4>UAS-miR-X; GFP::atf3 and controls)

In both mammals and insects, ORNs majorly express a single OR gene. To identify the targets that are necessary for the proper 0R expression in Drosophila, the list of miRNAs that gave the selective loss of OR expression were analyzed. The possible RNAi hits were based on the
following criterion, first- the overlapping targets in both UTR and ORF among the miRNAs that showed the same phenotype were set as the highest priority, second-the overlapping targets among different miRNAs showing the highest complementary seed sequence pairing was used and  the number of hydrogen bond pairing were counted for the strength among individual targets. The bioinformatics programs Targetscan fly, miRanda and Microcosm were used to narrow on > 40 RNAi lines for the follow up screen. (Fig 3a, Supplementary fig 2)

The RNAi were expressed in post mitotic ORNs by pebbled GAL4 and OR expression was visualized by direct OR promoter fusions to GFP as described previously. In two separate rounds, the RNAi effect on the OR expression of two OR classes namely Or47b and Or92a was used, which led to identification of previously unknown role of new transcription factor, Atf3 which resulted in the strong and highly penetrant loss of Or47b expression. (Fig 3b). 

In order to exclude out false positives caused by off target effect, multiple atf3 RNAi lines were analyzed from BDSC and VDRC.  All the constructs gave rise to identical OR loss phenotype, supporting the specific knocks down of Atf3 transcription factor. Mixed Or47b probe
and Or92a probe in situ hybridization was performed on atf3 knock down flies to validate the selective Or47b loss. (Fig 3c)

For the establishing a direct role between atf3 and over-expression of certain miRNA  that resulted in  selective knock down of Atf3 transcript in Or47b neurons, we combined Pebbled GAL4 driving UAS-miRNA-2491 with atf3::EGFP construct. We hypothesized that the miRNA over- expression should also result in the loss of Atf3 expression. Immunostaining was performed and result--- (yet to complete). (Fig 3d)
