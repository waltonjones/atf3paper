## Secondary RNAi screen for miRNA targets that modify OR expression

According to the screening protocol outlined in **\ref{fig:2}A**, we next compiled lists of possible target genes for each of the miRNAs whose overexpression eliminates Or47b expression. We initially compared the outputs of multiple target prediction algorithms (i.e., TargetScan, miRanda, and PITA), as this seems to be standard practice \cite{am_Namkoong_Lee_Chung_Kim_2009,agen_Okamura_Perrimon_Lai_2007}. **Figure \ref{fig:3}A** compares the numbers of candidate targets predicted for each miRNA that induces loss of Or47b by the [TargetScan](http://www.targetscan.org/fly_12/) \cite{ohnston_Kellis_Bartel_Lai_2007}, [miRanda](http://www.microrna.org) \cite{Gaul_Tuschl_Sander_Marks_2003}, and [PITA](http://genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/mir07/mir07_dyn_data.html) \cite{ino_Unnerstall_Gaul_Segal_2007} algorithms. 

Typically, miRNA-based screens using Gal4 lines that drive expression in well-characterized tissues would allow a list of predicted miRNA targets to be prioritized based on expression in the tissue of interest. In this case, however, without access to transcriptomic data for olfactory neurons, we decided to prioritize our secondary RNAi screen by looking for overlap between the lists of candidate targets for each miRNA whose overexpression produced the loss of Or47b phenotype. We decided to focus on TargetScan because it predicts miRNA seed matches in both 3'-UTRs and open reading frames as well as provides a way to query more recently identified miRNAs like miR-2491. PITA does not provide this option, and the miRanda algorithm produces too many predicted targets. We identified seven UAS-miRNA lines that eliminate Or47b expression. Together, TargetScan predicts 1399 unique targets for these seven miRNAs, but only 231 unique candidates appear on two lists and 22 unique candidates appear on three lists (**Fig. \ref{fig:3}B-C**).
