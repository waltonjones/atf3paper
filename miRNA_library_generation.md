## UAS-miRNA library generation

According to the most recent release of [miRBase](http://mirbase.org) , roughly 65% of the 238 annotated miRNAs in the *Drosophila* genome are "high confidence" annotations \cite{Kozomara_Griffiths-Jones_2013}. When we began this project, although there were no publicly available fly stocks for tissue-specific miRNA overexpression, a group of UAS-DsRed-miRNA DNA constructs representing many of these important miRNAs had been published by Silver et al. \cite{agen_Okamura_Perrimon_Lai_2007}. In these constructs, 400-500 nucleotide pri-miRNA regions were inserted into the 3'-UTR of the fluorescent protein DsRed, itself part of a P-element-based UAS transgenesis vector. To facilitate the genetics of our proposed screening protocol, we decided to generate a library of site-specific insertions of these constructs. In addition to adding attB recombinase recognition sites to 40 existing of these UAS-DsRed-miRNA constructs, we amplified and inserted many similar 400-500 nucleotide pri-miRNA sequences into the 3'-UTR of a similar UAS vector containing either DsRed or mCherry and an attB site. Clustered miRNAs were generally cloned en masse, but some were cloned individually (**Fig. \ref{fig:1}A**).  In total, our UAS-miRNA library includes 137 stocks covering 159 *Drosophila* miRNAs (see Supplemental Table 1 for details). 

## Verification of miRNA expression

We used several techniques to verify the expressibility and function of our UAS-miRNA lines. Since the miRNA sequences were placed in the 3'-UTR of either DsRed or mCherry, we were able to visually verify the expression of the marker after crossing it to the eye driver GMR-Gal4 (**Fig. \ref{fig:1}B**). We also observed several very obvious developmental phenotypes induced by miRNA overexpression in the wing and eye. Using the wing driver nubbin-Gal4, we observed miRNAs that induced wing notching, thinning of wing veins, loss of marginal bristles, and other more severe deformities (**Fig. \ref{fig:1}C**). With GMR-Gal4, we observed rough eyes, smooth eyes, small eyes, and changes in pigmentation (**Fig. \ref{fig:1}D**). We also directly verified the overexpression of a few select miRNAs using commercially available Taqman qPCR kits (data not shown). Since we began generating these UAS-miRNA lines, three other collections using of UAS-miRNA lines using a similar cloning strategy have been published and made available to the *Drosophila* community \cite{http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.111.136689, http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/dev.079939, http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.112.145383}.
