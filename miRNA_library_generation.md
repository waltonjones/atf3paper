## UAS-miRNA library generation

According to the most recent release of [miRBase](http://mirbase.org) \cite{http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt1181}, roughly 65% of the 238 annotated miRNAs in the *Drosophila* genome are "high confidence" annotations. When we began this project, although there were no publicly available fly stocks for tissue-specific miRNA overexpression, a group of UAS-DsRed-miRNA DNA constructs representing many of these important miRNAs had been published by Silver et al. \cite{agen_Okamura_Perrimon_Lai_2007}. In these constructs, 400-500 nucleotide pri-miRNA regions were inserted into the 3'-UTR of the fluorescent protein DsRed, itself part of a P-element-based UAS transgenesis vector. To facilitate the genetics of our proposed screening protocol, we decided to generate a library of site-specific insertions of these constructs. In addition to adding attB recombinase recognition sites to 40 existing of these UAS-DsRed-miRNA constructs, we amplified and inserted many similar 400-500 nucleotide pri-miRNA sequences into the 3'-UTR of a similar UAS vector containing either DsRed or mCherry and an attB site. Clustered miRNAs were generally cloned en masse, but some were cloned individually (Fig. \ref{fig:1}A).  In total, our UAS-miRNA library includes 137 stocks covering 159 *Drosophila* miRNAs (see Supplemental Table 1 for details).
